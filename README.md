## Rust Learning Projects

This repository contains my Rust programming projects as I learn and practice the language. It serves as both a learning journey and version control for my Rust code.

### About

I'm using this repository to:

- Practice Rust programming concepts
- Store and track my learning progress
- Experiment with different Rust features
- Build small projects and exercises
